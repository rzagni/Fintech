        "\n",
        " 1. **Load and Explore Financial News Data:**\n",
        "    - Load a preprocessed dataset of financial news headlines and summaries related to S&P 500 companies.\n",
        "    - Inspect and structure relevant metadata including publication date, ticker, and provider.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. **Build a Custom Vector Store:**\n",
        "    - Combine title and summary text for embedding.\n",
        "    - Implement a vector store from scratch with support for semantic search and optional metadata-based filtering using cosine similarity.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3. **Generate and Use Sentence Embeddings:**\n",
        "    - Apply a pre-trained transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to encode text into embeddings for semantic analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4. **Perform Semantic Search with Filtering:**\n",
        "    - Retrieve the most relevant news documents for a given query using both full-dataset and metadata-filtered searches.\n",
        "\n",
        " 5. **Analyze Semantic Search Results:**\n",
        "    - Interpret and visualize results of search queries (e.g., \"AI announcement\").\n",
        "    - Identify temporal patterns and ticker frequency among top-ranked results.\n",
        "\n",
        " 6. **Implement a FAISS-Based Vector Store:**\n",
        "    - Normalize embeddings and use FAISS (IndexFlatIP) to enable efficient similarity search at scale.\n",
        "    - Compare FAISS-based search results with custom vector store results.\n",
        "\n",
        " 7. **Critically Compare Search Systems:**\n",
        "    - Evaluate differences in similarity computation, speed, and scalability between custom and FAISS-based systems.\n",
        "    - Reflect on design trade-offs for real-world vector search systems."

        " ✅ **Requirements**:\n",

One major reason could be the corporate earnings season—many companies release their first-quarter results in April and May, often using the opportunity to highlight new AI initiatives to impress investors. Another likely reason is the timing of major tech events, such as Google I/O, Microsoft Build, or other AI-focused conferences, which typically occur around the same time and serve as platforms for big announcements. </font>\n",

        "<font color=\"green\">Additionally, as AI continues to dominate headlines, companies may feel pressure to publicly align themselves with the trend, resulting in a wave of press releases and product launches within the same period. Overall, the timing reflects both strategic communication choices and broader industry cycles.</font>\n"

        "\n",
        "<font color=\"green\">For the query AI announcement, the MiniLM model returned articles directly related to well-known AI companies. For example, it retrieved an article about Adobe discussing AI stock performance and another about Palantir’s AI platform and its growth in 2025. These match the query closely because they describe real announcements from companies involved in AI. On the other hand, the mpnet model returned broader topics, such as a quote from the CEO of Republic Services saying AI is “wildly oversold,” and an article about Dell and HP discussing AI computers. While still related to AI, these results are more general and less announcement-focused. This suggests MiniLM gave more accurate matches for this specific query.</font>\n",
        "\n",
        "F<font color=\"green\">or stock dividend increase, the mpnet model performed slightly better. It returned a diverse set of companies such as Nasdaq (NDAQ), Otis (OTIS), Paychex (PAYX), and Equifax (EFX), all with specific dividend changes. While the MiniLM model also found strong results, like LyondellBasell (LYB) and VICI Properties (VICI), mpnet covered more ground and identified a broader range of relevant dividend updates.</font>\n",
        "\n",
        "<font color=\"green\">In the case of quarterly earnings report, MiniLM again provided better results. It retrieved articles clearly focused on Q1 earnings from companies like Campbell Soup (CPB), CF Industries (CF), and Aptiv (APTV), including specific dates and revenue estimates. In contrast, the mpnet model returned more general summaries, like commentary on GE Healthcare and Humana’s earnings, which were less directly tied to earnings reports. This shows MiniLM’s strength in retrieving precise financial news.</font>\n",
        "\n",
        "<font color=\"green\">For merger and acquisition, MiniLM found targeted results such as the merger between Synopsys (SNPS) and Ansys (ANSS), and Capital One's (COF) Discover deal. These directly address M\\&A activity. The mpnet model returned more speculative content, like Citigroup’s acquisition watchlist or Kraft Heinz exploring future deals. While still relevant, these results were not as grounded in concrete M\\&A events. MiniLM performed better by surfacing confirmed transactions.</font>\n",
        "\n",
        "<font color=\"green\">Lastly, for market outlook for tech stocks, the mpnet model showed an advantage. It included rich content like Dell’s earnings forecast and company-specific market strategies, along with broad market trends. MiniLM returned good articles as well, including one from Simply Wall St. about high-growth tech stocks, but mpnet’s results included more detail and forward-looking analysis. This made them more informative for a market outlook question.</font>\n",
        "\n",
        "<font color=\"green\">Conclusion, MiniLM seems to performs better when the query requires clear, factual answers—like earnings announcements or mergers. Mpnet is better at understanding broad or nuanced queries, offering deeper and more varied results when the topic is more general, such as market trends or investment strategies.</font>\n"

        "\n",
        "<font color=\"green\">In the Custom Vector Store, normalization is done automatically. This happens because the `cosine_similarity` function from the sklearn library normalize the vectors before comparing them. This is important because cosine similarity cares about the direction of the vectors, not their magnitude. So even if two pieces of text are very similar in meaning but one has a bigger vector, the similarity score won’t be impacted if they’re both normalized.</font>\n",
        "\n",
        "<font color=\"green\">In the FAISS Vector Store, normalization is not automatic and we had to do it outselves. FAISS uses inner product to compare vectors. To ensure inner product works like cosine similarity, we need to normalize all vectors before adding them to the index and also before searching. If we didn't use normalization, FAISS might favor longer vectors, which can give poor results.</font>\n",
        "\n",
        "<font color=\"green\">In our case, since both vector stores gave the same results, that means normalization was correctly applied to the FAISS vectors too. This made sure both systems were comparing the meaning of the texts in the same way. </font>\n",

        "<font color=\"green\">If vectors are not normalized before indexing, the results of similarity search can become misleading—especially when using cosine similarity or FAISS with inner product. Cosine similarity works by comparing the angle between vectors, so if vectors aren’t normalized, their length affects the result. This means longer vectors might seem more similar, even if they aren’t close in meaning.</font>\n",
        "\n",
        "<font color=\"green\">In FAISS, if you skip normalization and use inner product to approximate cosine similarity, the system will treat longer vectors as more important. As a result, it might return documents that are less relevant, just because their vectors are bigger. So without normalization, search quality drops, and the results may no longer reflect true semantic similarity.</font>\n",

FAISS is built to handle very large datasets efficiently and can search through millions of vectors much faster than simpler methods like scikit-learn’s cosine similarity.

On top of that, FAISS supports GPU acceleration, which can significantly boost performance for high-demand applications.\n",

FAISS is specifically designed for large-scale vector search and offers several advanced features that make it ideal for handling millions or even billions of document embeddings. It supports multiple indexing techniques like Inverted File Index (IVF) and Product Quantization (PQ), which allow it to efficiently manage large datasets, even when they don’t fully fit in memory (RAM).</font>\n",

Additionally, FAISS supports GPU acceleration, which further boosts speed and responsiveness in real-time systems.

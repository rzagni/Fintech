        "<font color=\"green\">Yes, reranking improved the average position of the correct news. The mean rank position decreased from 0.32 before reranking to 0.16 after applying the reranker. Since lower values indicate that the correct item is retrieved closer to the top of the results list, this shows that reranking made it easier for the system to place the right news item in a more prominent position. In practice, this means users would more often find the correct result without having to scan far down the list.\n",
        "\n",
        "<font color=\"green\">On the other hand, the standard deviation also dropped from 1.08 to 0.69. This matters because it shows that reranking not only improved the average rank but also reduced variability across queries. In other words, the system became more consistent: it was less likely to make large mistakes where the correct news appeared much further down in the ranking.\n",
        "\n",
        "<font color=\"green\">Taken together, these results show that reranking contributed both to accuracy and reliability. The correct news was positioned closer to the top more often, and the performance was steadier across different questions. This suggests that the reranker helped create a retrieval process that is not only more effective but also more predictable for users.</font>\n"

This means that reranking improved the system’s ability to place the right article at the very top of the results list, increasing accuracy by 4 percentage points. While the improvement may seem small, it is meaningful because it reflects a higher likelihood that users immediately see the correct answer without needing to search down the ranked list.</font>\n",
        "\n",
        "<font color=\"green\">It is also important to note that retrieval using FAISS alone was already strong, since the correct article was found at position 0 in the majority of cases. However, reranking with the cross-encoder built on this solid baseline and pushed performance a little further, ensuring that the most relevant article was surfaced first more often. This demonstrates the value of reranking as a refinement step where even when the base retriever is performing well, reranking helps fine-tune the order of results to better match relevance.</font>"
